# Tests with Spring Data JPA

Have you ever wondered why Hibernate sometimes executes a select statement before the insert?

This happens when the Id is assigned by the program and not generated by Hibernate and @Version is not used.
See [Person](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/Person.java)

To avoid this select statement either use @GeneratedValue as in [PersonWithGeneratedId](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/PersonWithGeneratedId.java)
or if you want to assign the Id you must use @Version as in [PersonWithVersion](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/PersonWithVersion.java)
