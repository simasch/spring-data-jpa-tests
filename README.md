# Spring Data JPA 

## Problem

Have you ever wondered why Hibernate sometimes executes a select statement before the insert?

This happens when the Id is assigned by the program and not generated by Hibernate and @Version is not used.
See [Person](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/Person.java)

## Solutions

To avoid this select statement there are two solutions:

1. Either use @GeneratedValue as in [PersonWithGeneratedId](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/PersonWithGeneratedId.java)

2. or if you want to assign the Id you must use @Version as in [PersonWithVersion](src/main/java/ch/martinelli/demo/jpa/PersonWithVersion.java)
